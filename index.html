                         Today in the news, there is a new Follichite Ceremony taking place today. All non-ops are invited to attend. This ceremony will involve the sacrifice of a goat to
                    please Lord, Sir, Mr. Follicle. The Follicle has also announced that he wants suitable candidates for a Mrs. Follicle by the end of the week. The last Follicle

                    of the Follicle" — Lord, Sir, Mr. Follicle
